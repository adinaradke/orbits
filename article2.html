          NASA has received and is reviewing 12 proposals for future unmanned solar system exploration. The proposed missions of discovery will undergo scientific and technical review over the next seven months. The goal is to select a mission for flight in about two years, with launch in the mid-2020s.

          »New Frontiers is about answering the biggest questions in our solar system today, building on previous missions to continue to push the frontiers of exploration,« said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. »We’re looking forward to reviewing these exciting investigations and moving forward with our next bold mission of discovery.« 
          <br>
          Selection of one or more concepts for Phase A study will be announced in November. At the conclusion of Phase A concept studies, it is planned that one New Frontiers investigation will be selected to continue into subsequent mission phases. Mission proposals are selected following an extensive competitive peer review process.

          The data that led to these hints at MU69’s nature were gathered over six weeks in June and July, when the team made three attempts to place telescopes in the narrow shadow of MU69 as it passed in front of a star. The most valuable recon came on July 17, when five telescopes deployed by the New Horizons team in Argentina were in the right place at the right time to catch this fleeting shadow — an event known as an occultation – and capture important data on MU69’s size, shape and orbit. That data raised the possibility that MU69 might be two like-sized objects, or what’s known as a binary.
